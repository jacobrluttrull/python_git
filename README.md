# python_git (libwyag learning)

This repository is a small, hands-on learning project to explore how Git works under the hood.

Purpose
- Learn Git internals by implementing parts of it in Python.
- Use the tutorial as a guide; write and comment code in libwyag.py to understand each step.

What this is
- A learning tool, not a production Git implementation.
- libwyag.py contains the working code and inline notes written while following the tutorial.

How to use
- Read libwyag.py to follow the implementation and comments.
- Run or modify the code to test and deepen your understanding.
- Commit changes as you experiment to practice real Git workflows.

Notes
- Focus is on learning and experimentation.
- Expect incomplete features — that's intentional for educational purposes.
